#1, when familirizing ourselves with the Hopper + Grater (Tom & Morten), we used the .PDF (name of it?). Page #2 of the .pdf doesn't have parts numbers on the biggest #4 pieces (they are for the hopper).
#2, (same session as above): We found that the .pdf says that the bars for the grater are "Rebars" (as in "round"), but they are in fact flat.
#3, (same as above): In pdf, page 59: It says it's cut from part #99, but what is meant is part #9.
#4, suggestions for the BOM: that under each part, it says what it is used for (of diff. parts/items).
